# My-chatbot
A simple chatbot
dataset: cornell movie conversation
Porgram is based on word2vec, bert.ipynb can also provide word vectors, but is not used in chatbot (just let me get familiar) 

Datapre: word2vec program, works well for small dataset (too slow for large one, thus change to gensim), part of the code is from homework assignment example program, the other reference can be found in comments
